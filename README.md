# üèê VolleyRank

**Smart team builder for volleyball coaches and organizers**

Stop guessing who should play where. VolleyRank uses proven mathematics to:
- Rate each player's skill at every position they can play (Setter, Opposite, Outside Hitter, Middle Blocker, Libero)
- Compare players through simple head-to-head matchups
- Automatically create balanced teams using advanced optimization algorithms

Perfect for training sessions where you need fair teams fast.

## Features

- **Multi-Position Support**: Players can play multiple positions, each with independent ELO ratings
- **Position-Based Comparisons**: Compare players at specific positions to build accurate skill ratings
- **Smart Comparison System**: Prioritizes comparing players with fewer previous comparisons
- **Position-Specific Rankings**: View separate rankings for each volleyball position
- **Intelligent Team Builder**: Automatically create balanced teams using position-specific ratings
- **Data Persistence**: All data is saved locally in your browser with automatic migration from older versions
- **Import/Export**: Bulk import players via CSV/JSON and export your data

## Volleyball Positions

- **S** - Setter
- **OPP** - Opposite
- **OH** - Outside Hitter
- **MB** - Middle Blocker
- **L** - Libero

## How to Use

### 1. Add Players
- Go to the **Settings** tab
- Enter player name
- Select **all positions** the player can play (multiple selections allowed)
- Click "Add Player"

**Example**: A player who can play both Outside Hitter and Middle Blocker will have separate ELO ratings for each position.

### 2. Compare Players
- Go to the **Compare** tab
- Select a position from the dropdown (e.g., "Outside Hitters")
- Click on the better player in each matchup
- **Only the rating for that specific position will change**
- The system prioritizes pairs who haven't been compared yet

### 3. View Rankings
- Go to the **Rankings** tab to see players ranked by position
- Each position shows only players who can play that position
- Rankings display position-specific ELO ratings and comparison counts

### 4. Create Teams
- Go to the **Teams** tab
- Set the number of teams (2-+inf)
- Define team composition (players per position)
- Click "Create Teams" for optimally balanced team suggestions
- The optimizer uses each player's rating for their assigned position

### 5. Import/Export Players
- **Export**: Download your player list as CSV
- **Import**: Upload CSV or JSON files, or paste data directly
- **CSV Format**: `name,positions` (e.g., `"John Smith","OH,MB"`)
- **Template**: Download a sample CSV template to get started

## How It Works

### Multiple Position Rating System
- Each player starts with **1500 ELO** for each of their positions
- When comparing players at a position, **only that position's rating changes**
- Example: If "John" (OH/MB) beats "Alice" (OH) at Outside Hitter:
  - John's OH rating increases
  - Alice's OH rating decreases
  - John's MB rating remains unchanged

### Team Formation Algorithm

The team optimizer uses a multi-algorithm approach with position-specific ratings:

#### 1. Initial Solution Generation
- **Snake Draft**: Top players distributed in serpentine pattern (1-2-3-3-2-1)
- **Balanced Rating**: Players assigned to teams with lowest current total rating
- **Random Solutions**: Multiple random distributions for diversity

#### 2. Advanced Optimization
- **Simulated Annealing**: 50,000 iterations with cooling schedule
  - Temperature starts at 1000, cools by 0.995 per iteration
  - Accepts worse solutions probabilistically to escape local optima
- **Position-Aware Swaps**: Only swaps players at same position between teams
- **Multi-Candidate Selection**: Compares 4+ different optimization approaches

#### 3. Position-Specific Rating Usage
- Players are assigned to positions where they can play
- **Uses the player's rating for their assigned position**, not an average
- Example: Player with OH=1600, MB=1450 assigned to OH uses 1600 rating

#### 4. Balance Evaluation
- **Team Balance**: Minimizes difference between strongest/weakest teams
- **Rating Variance**: Penalizes uneven talent distribution
- **Target**: < 300 ELO difference between teams

### Comparison System
- Filters players by selected position
- Prioritizes players with fewest comparisons at that position
- Excludes pairs already compared at that position
- Randomizes selection among suitable pairs for fairness

### Import/Export Formats

#### CSV Format
```csv
name,positions
"John Smith","OH,MB"
"Alice Johnson","S"
"Bob Williams","MB"
"Sarah Davis","L"
"Mike Brown","OPP,OH"
```

#### JSON Format
```json
[
  {
    "name": "John Smith",
    "positions": ["OH", "MB"]
  },
  {
    "name": "Alice Johnson",
    "positions": ["S"]
  }
]
```
