## 😫 Sound Familiar?

- **Endless arguments** about who should be on which team
- **Unbalanced teams** where one side dominates every time
- **Wasted time** manually distributing players/participants
- **Subjective assessments** based on emotions and personal preferences
- **Unhappy participants** due to unfair distribution

## ✨ The Solution — TeamBalance

- 📊 **Objectivity**: Rating system based on real comparisons
- 🔄 **Flexibility**: Account for multiple positions per participant
- 💾 **Persistence**: All data saved automatically

## 🚀 How It Works

### Simple. Intuitive. Effective.

**1️⃣ Add Participants**
- Enter names
- Specify positions/roles they can fill
- Done! (5 seconds per participant)

**2️⃣ Compare Skills**
- System shows you pairs of participants
- Choose who's better at a specific position
- Just 10-15 comparisons — and ratings are ready!

**3️⃣ Create Teams**
- Click "Create Teams" button
- Algorithm finds optimal distribution
- Get balanced teams in seconds!

### 🧠 The Magic Behind It

TeamBalance uses **ELO rating** — a proven system used in chess, esports, and professional leagues worldwide. The system automatically accounts for:
- Each participant's strength at every position
- Unexpected results (surprises provide more information)
- Continuous rating improvements

Then a **genetic optimization algorithm** finds the best team distribution, considering all ratings and positions.

**The result?** Teams as balanced as mathematically possible.
