## Volleyball Positions

- **S** - Setter

### 2. Compare Players

## How It Works

### ELO Rating System
- Initial rating for each player: 1500
- K-factor: 30 (determines the speed of rating change)
- Rating changes based on expected match outcome

### Team Formation Algorithm
1. **Position Distribution**: players are distributed according to specified composition
2. **Snake Draft**: strongest players are distributed in snake pattern between teams
3. **Optimization**: 20,000 iterations of random swaps to improve balance
4. **Result**: teams with minimal difference in total rating

### Comparison System
- Priority given to players with fewest comparisons
- Excludes repeat comparisons between same players
- Random selection from suitable pairs for fairness
